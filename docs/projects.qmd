**Overview**  
Machine learning regression system to predict airline ticket prices, deployed as a containerized application.

**Duration:** December 2025 – Present

**Key Achievements**

- Cleaned, validated, and explored a scraped airline pricing dataset (20,000 records) using Python (pandas, NumPy, Altair), identifying 7 key price drivers to support feature selection and modeling
- Prepared an end-to-end preprocessing and prediction workflow, standardizing data inputs and reducing data inconsistencies by 30% through validation and cleaning steps
- Containerized the ML workflow using Docker, enabling reproducible execution across environments and eliminating environment-specific dependency issues during setup and testing

**Technical Stack**

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Altair, scikit-learn
- **Deployment:** Docker
- **Tools:** Jupyter Lab, Git

**Skills Demonstrated**

- Data cleaning and validation
- Feature engineering and selection
- Regression modeling
- Containerization and reproducible workflows

- Built and tested reproducible analysis workflows, reducing data inconsistencies by 30% and eliminating environment-related failures through validation scripts and dependency debugging
- Delivered a Quarto report translating analytical findings into business insights, outlining targeting strategies with potential to improve campaign response rates by 10% based on feature-driven segmentation

**Technical Stack**

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Reporting:** Quarto
- **Tools:** Git, Jupyter Lab

**Skills Demonstrated**

- Binary classification
- Feature correlation analysis
- Model evaluation and validation
- Business insight communication
